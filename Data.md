### Topic 1:Image Captioning

##### 1. MS COCO Dataset: 

The MS COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014)  is a dataset used for image recognition, image detection, image segmentation and image captioning. For each image in the dataset, five different descriptions are provided. This dataset contains 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable. In the dataset, more than 300,000 images and a total of 2.5 million labeled instances are included.

##### 2. Flickr30K Dataset:

The Flickr30k (Plummer et al., 2015)  is a datasets contains 31,000 images collected from Flickr, together with 5 image descriptions provided by human annotators. It's a benchmark dataset for image retrieval, cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot cross-modal retrieval and image captioning.

##### 3. Flickr8K Dataset:

The Flickr8k (Hodosh et al., 2013)  is a datasets consisting of 8,000 images collected from Flickr, and  5 captions for each image. It's a benchmark dataset for image retrieval, cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. This dataset is small in size and the modal can be trained faster and easier.
